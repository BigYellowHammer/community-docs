## FAQ

### What is OVOS?

OVOS aims to be a full operating system that is free and open source. The Open Voice Operating System consists of OVOS packages (programs specifically released by the OVOS Project) as well as free software released by third parties such as skills and plugins. The development of OVOS makes it possible to voice enable technology without software that would trample your freedom.

Historically OVOS has been used to refer to several things, the team, the github organization and the reference buildroot implementation
