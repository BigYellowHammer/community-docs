# PHAL

[PHAL](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos_PHAL) is our Platform/Hardware Abstraction Layer, it completely replaces the
concept of hardcoded "enclosure" from mycroft-core

Any number of plugins providing functionality can be loaded and validated at runtime, plugins can
be [system integrations](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-system) to handle things like reboot and
shutdown, or hardware drivers such as [mycroft mark2 plugin](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-mk2)

PHAL plugins can perform actions such as hardware detection before loading, eg, the mark2 plugin will not load if it
does not detect the sj201 hat. This makes plugins safe to install and bundle by default in our base images
